# NDIS Filter Driver Skeleton

## Introduction

This is a minimal NDIS filter driver based on the [NDIS Filter Driver Sample on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/network/ndis/filter). It doesn't do anything and most of the NDIS functions are not implemented, but it demonstrates the absolute minimal skeleton code required. Please read [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/initializing-a-filter-driver) to understand the minimal initialisation required.
